# Face-and-Eye-Detector
Python code of OpenCV which detects the eyes and face using simple haar-like features and Viola Jones algorithm.

This repo contains my face and eye detector which I created using OpenCV and Voila Jones Algorithm.

In here I have given the main python file with comments which is really easy to understand and two xml files eachone for eye and face detection.
